WELCOME TO MRS.OANH ENGLISH
AI Voice Chat for English Speaking Practice

 🤗 Mrs.Oanh English is an application I built for my mother, an English teacher, to help learners practice speaking English naturally through AI Voice Chat.

 🧐 Learners can create and engage in conversations based on their chosen vocabulary or sentence patterns. The app generates dialogues within specific topics or situations, allowing learners to practice communication, pronunciation, and real usage of English expressions.

 📌Key Features:
  - Create Lessons: Enter a topic, sentence patterns, and vocabulary; select one of three levels (Beginner – Intermediate – Advanced); add an avatar (upload or AI-generated – AI generation currently under development).
  - Download & Save Data: Learners can save their created lessons locally.
  - Upload to Website: Easily upload and manage lessons on the platform.
  - In-Conversation Dictionary: Instantly look up words with IPA, Vietnamese meaning, English definition, and usage examples.
  - Vocabulary Management: Save looked-up words into a personal word list and review them with Flashcards.
  - Dynamic Customization: During Voice Chat, learners can add new vocabulary, modify sentence patterns, or adjust the difficulty level of the conversation at any time.

👉 This app is designed to make English speaking practice more flexible, personalized, and interactive, helping learners build confidence and fluency step by step.

⚡ Note: The app still has some limitations since I don’t yet have a server to store the database. However, I truly hope to receive feedback from everyone so I can keep improving and make this product more complete.
